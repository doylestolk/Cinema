PHP version 7.3

1. Create database with name: cinema
2. Restore backup in the Scripts folder
3. Change database login credentials in login.php
4. Run on your IDE or AMPPS server and enjoy

This is my first project and I must admit that it was really challenging.
Up until a few days ago I had no Idea how to manipulate data from a database.
I hope you enjoy the results as much as I enjoyed developing this.
